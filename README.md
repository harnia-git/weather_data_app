**Title: Interactive Weather Visualization App**

**Description:**

This Flask-based web application provides an interactive platform for users to visualize historical weather data for any specified location. Users can enter latitude, longitude, and the number of past days they are interested in to fetch detailed weather data from the Open Meteo API. The app dynamically generates temperature graphs that display minimum and maximum temperature trends over the specified period.

**Key Features:**

- **User Input for Custom Queries:** Users can specify the exact geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the timeframe in terms of past days to view historical weather data.
- **Dynamic Weather Graphs:** The application generates a graph that visualizes daily minimum and maximum temperatures, offering insights into weather patterns.
- **Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Leveraging the Open Meteo API, the app fetches real-time weather data based on user input, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information.
- **Ease of Use:** A simple and intuitive interface ensures that users can easily navigate the app and get the information they need with minimal effort.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Flask:** Serves as the backend framework to handle web server requests and integrates seamlessly with Python libraries.
- **Pandas:** Utilized for data manipulation and analysis to prepare data for visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** Powers the generation of weather graphs, transforming raw data into comprehensible visual formats.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used to craft the frontend layout and style the presentation of the application.

**Use Case:**

Ideal for researchers, weather enthusiasts, and the general public interested in historical weather patterns of a specific location. This tool is particularly useful for educational purposes, environmental studies, and travel planning.
